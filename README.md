### Key Improvements:

2. **Project Description**: Added a brief description of the project to explain what it does.
3. **Sections**:
   - **Features**: Summarizes the main features of your application.
   - **Screenshots**: Shows the images with better context by adding section headers and some space around them.
   - **Technologies Used**: Lists the tech stack to give context about the development tools used.
   - **How to Run**: Provides clear instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
   - **Contributing**: Adds a section encouraging collaboration and contributions.
   - **License**: Includes a typical license section if applicable.
4. **Formatting**: 
   - Added horizontal lines (`---`) to visually separate sections.
   - Better organization of the content with subheadings to guide the reader through the sections.
   - Added code block formatting for terminal commands like `git clone` and `mvnw spring-boot:run`.
5. **Visual Enhancements**: 
   - Descriptive text added above the images to explain what each screenshot shows.
   - Proper use of Markdown and HTML together to create a neat and well-spaced presentation.

This structure not only makes your `README.md` more visually appealing but also makes it more informative for others who might want to understand or contribute to your project.
